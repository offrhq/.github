Our privacy policy is really simple: we donâ€™t record any personal data. We only use cookies that are essential for third party authentication. We may collect aggregate non-personal data.

In cases where you interact with us or our software through other services, those interactions are subject to separate privacy policies from those third parties which we cannot control.
